GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets â€“ anything your project needs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.
